The game Pike & Wall is a game, in which the story let's you at first play events from the Italian wars at the start of the 16th century. 

As a condottiere, the leader of a band of mercenaries, you get to help the famous General Fernandez Gonzalo de Cordoba liberate the complete south of Italy from French occupation. 

Later in the campaign you even get to part from the so far historically accurate path and forge your own destiny, by leading your army across Greece to the holy city of Constantinople, liberating it from the Ottoman Empire.

The story is narrated and supported by 5 fleshed out and fully voiced characters like General de Cordoba for example, who either fill the player with a sense of purpose, or guide and help him on his journey.
